*Say goodbye to sluggish cloud APIs, expensive subscriptions, and invasive data sharing.* <br>
*Say hello to **Smart Presence**—where state-of-the-art AI meets zero-trust architecture.*

</div>

## 🌟 Why Smart Presence?

Traditional attendance systems are slow, cloud-dependent, and invasive. **Smart Presence** flips the script by prioritizing speed, privacy, and user experience:

- **🔐 100% Zero-Cloud Architecture**: No Supabase, no Firebase, no AWS. Your biometric data and records never leave your local hardware. Complete GDPR & FERPA compliance out of the box.
- **⚡ AI-Native Edge Processing**: Powered by a heavily optimized **InsightFace** engine that runs blazingly fast entirely on standard CPUs. No expensive GPUs required.
- **🤖 Agentic Ready (MCP)**: The world's first attendance system equipped with a built-in **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** bridge, allowing your favorite LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT) to interact with your school data as a local tool.
- **📱 Premium "Liquid Glass" PWA**: A stunning, installable Progressive Web App featuring haptic feedback, 60FPS camera scanning, background animations, and an adaptive UI.
